# Welcome to Chain Letter

Chain Letter is Now Loading's first collaborative project! This app will be used as a creative writing tool for writers and readers. 

## Writers
Writers can start their own story chain or add a link to an existing chain. You can only write up to 240 characters per link and you can only link off other user's links. You can add a link to any link within an existing chain (not just the end of the chain). 

## Readers
Readers will start at the beginning of any story. If there are multiple links branching from one link in the story chain, they will they will have the ability to choose which link they'd like to move to or be directed to a random link of all the possible links from their current link.

## Developers

### Install and Run
Once you've forked this repo, clone the newly forked repo in your terminal in whatever directory you want to store the project. Then run the following commands:
```
cd ./chainletter
npm i
npm run start
```
### Assign Issues
The issues tab on this project will continually be maintained. Peruse the issues page to find any issues you'd like to work on. Issues marked "good first issue" are a good start if you're not sure what to work on. Please post a message in the Now Loading Discord server if you're unsure where to start or if you have any questions with a particular issue.

### Pair Programming
Some issues will be labeled Pair Programming to indicate a good task to program with a fellow NL member, however you may pair program with someone on any task you want. If you wish to pair program with someone on a certain task, let us know on the NL Discord and be sure to assign both the programmers that will work on the task. 

## More to Come
This README file will continue to develop as we make progress on the project. Some issues will include making additions to this very file.
